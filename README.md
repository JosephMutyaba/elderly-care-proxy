# Proposal for Elderly Care and Support System

## Overview

The **Elderly Care and Support System** aims to assist caregivers and healthcare providers in monitoring and managing the health and well-being of elderly individuals. This system includes real-time monitoring of health metrics, emergency alerts, and detailed activity logs to ensure timely interventions when necessary. It enhances care quality by allowing caregivers to track health trends, receive notifications of emergencies, and generate reports for better decision-making.

## Objectives

- Develop a user-friendly dashboard that provides caregivers with key health data and alerts.
- Implement real-time health monitoring, including heart rate, blood pressure, and movement activity.
- Integrate an emergency alert system to notify caregivers and family members of critical health events.
- Maintain detailed activity logs to monitor elderly individuals' daily activities and detect potential issues.
- Allow caregivers to generate comprehensive health reports for tracking progress and assessing care needs.

## Technology Stack

- **Frontend**: Next.js and React Native for building a responsive and interactive user interface.
- **Backend**: Spring Boot for resource management, data handling, and real-time updates.
- **Database**: MySQL and Firebase for managing health data, emergency alerts, and user profiles.
- **Version Control**: Git for code management and collaboration.
- **Project Management**: GitLab for repository hosting and issue tracking.
- **Real-time Monitoring**: Firebase can handle real-time data updates, making it ideal for real-time health monitoring features. It is easy to integrate with both web and mobile platforms, allowing instant updates for critical health alerts.
- **Notification System**: WebSockets and email notifications for critical alerts using Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM).
